# Kopi Programming Language

Kopi is a programming language that copies from the modern comfort of Java and blends it with the simplicity and power of C. It is like Java if it wasn't object oriented and had pointers.

I find Java mostly pleasant to program in, but I'd rather not be forced to write my programs in classes and compile to the JVM, and I appreciate how simple C is and how easy it is to know how exactly how your C code will be executed on the machine. Kopi attempts to merge the best of both worlds into a modern yet powerful systems programming language.

See the docs for more detailed information about the language.

## Kopi-C compiler

Kopi-C is the official compiler for Kopi, implemented using LLVM.
